/**
 * Where an overlay has to appear when the document is not a viewport.
 *
 * The host sizes this plugin's iframe to the height the plugin reports, so the
 * frame is as tall as its own content and the browser viewport scrolls the
 * parent document instead. Two consequences drive everything here.
 *
 * `position: fixed` resolves against the frame, not against what the operator
 * can see. A sheet centred with `inset: 0` on a frame taller than the window
 * lands below the fold, and the click reads as doing nothing.
 *
 * `vh` units have the same defect: `calc(100vh - 40px)` is the frame height
 * minus 40, which is not a ceiling at all. And `position: sticky` never
 * activates, because sticky needs a scrollport and the frame has none.
 *
 * So overlays are positioned in DOCUMENT coordinates, anchored to whatever the
 * operator just clicked, and capped in px. The frame does not scroll, so an
 * element that was visible enough to click is still visible.
 *
 * Ported from lattice-plugin-sub-store/ui/src/overlayAnchor.ts. Kept
 * DOM-independent (the event target is duck-typed) so the tests run without
 * jsdom.
