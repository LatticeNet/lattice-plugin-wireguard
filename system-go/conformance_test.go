// A manifest declares which methods a plugin exposes and — since `backing` — who
// actually serves each one. This test holds the artifact to that promise.
//
// It exists because the promise used to go unchecked. Official plugins shipped signed
// manifests declaring interface methods their own artifacts could not answer, and
// lattice-server quietly answered them from an in-core handler instead. Nothing caught
// it: every suite covered what the artifact DOES, never what the manifest CLAIMS. A
// contract nobody verifies is a contract that drifts, and this is the gate that turns
// that drift into a red build.
//
// This plugin is a core-backed front: it owns the UI, the validation, and the workflow
// intent, while the engine stays in lattice-server (ADR-001 D5). Its artifact therefore
// implements no `call` action at all — and that is now a declared fact the manifest
// states out loud, not something the host has to infer from a publisher name.
